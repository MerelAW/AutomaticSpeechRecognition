# AutomaticSpeechRecognition

This project was done for the course ASR.

In Create_Audio_Overlap.ipynb, audio fragments from TIMIT are merged to create audio fragments with overlapping speech. 

In Create-Spectrograms.ipynb, these audio fragments are converted to spectrograms.

In CNN_Spectrograms.ipynb, a CNN is trained to predict whether or not there is overlap in an audio fragment, using the corresponding spectrograms.
